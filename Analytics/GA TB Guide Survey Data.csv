R_2y8AVLPBtfHKaFy,5 - Extremely useful,5 - Extremely useful,The set up allows very easy navigation for diagnostic and treatment purposes ,Not really a negative but more of a question- how frequently will updates be made ?
R_PSZQadIentdO1Fv,3,3,Having it on my phone will be helpful when answering phone calls with questions,"The ""search"" or magnifying glass is not as easy to use as the paper/PDF form. The results are very jumbled, difficult to read and look through"
R_22AgkqaO8ITsfAa,4,5 - Extremely useful,Easy to navigate and comprehensive. Liked the listing of district coordinator contact information. ,"Text sections were lacking in visual appeal, lots of typical script text. Diagnostic section could be enhanced, some visuals and/or figures could be nice. Would include some reference to WGS provided now for all TB isolates by CDC and availability of MDRD (rapid sequencing for determination of resistance mutations) through CDC. Also need to include updated guidance on new 4 month regimen for DS TB and BPAL regimen for MDR TB."

R_3j711wrUAp9R8Yq,5 - Extremely useful,5 - Extremely useful,"The interface is easy to use, with the most-accessed chapters and charts on the front page. ","Search results can be challenging to sift through, but I don't tend to use search as my go-to method to find information as the main chapters are the most useful"
R_28AL7yBEjfHiv0e,4,4,Convenience: I don't have to worry about having the physical booklet with me and can look things up whenever,"On the Dosages for LTBI treatment (Chart 5), the layout of the Rifapentine dosages for the Isoniazid and Rifapentine regimen is a little misleading. It lists the weight range, but then the recommended dosage for that weight is on the next line, right next to the next weight range. If you're not paying attention, it looks like 300mg is the recommended dosage for 14.1-25.0kg"
R_300FhEUbQGQgaqX,4,5 - Extremely useful,Makes searching easier,None
R_3npeZyqPrcQbbvz,4,4,I think that it will drive more use from providers who are new to evaluating TB,no negative feed back on the app. The only concern is the providers who already use the booklet will not convert to the app and by doing so may limit themselves to future real time guideline updates
