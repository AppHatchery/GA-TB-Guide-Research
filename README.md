# GA-TB-Guide-Research

Welcome to the GA-TB-Guide-Research repository! This repository contains the research assets utilized in writing the manuscript titled “An app is just available at all times” - the process and outcomes of converting the Georgia Tuberculosis Reference Guide into a Mobile Application. Here, you will find a comprehensive collection of resources that were instrumental in developing the app discussesd in the manuscript.

About the Manuscript

The manuscript "Guide to Genetic Algorithms for Tuberculosis Research" aims to provide researchers and practitioners in the field of tuberculosis (TB) with a comprehensive guide to leveraging genetic algorithms (GAs) for various aspects of TB research. It covers a wide range of topics, including data preprocessing, feature selection, predictive modeling, and optimization techniques.
Research Assets

The research assets in this repository are organized into the following categories:
1. Datasets

This section contains the datasets used in the manuscript for TB research. We have provided links to the publicly available datasets, along with descriptions and relevant citations. These datasets serve as a valuable resource for researchers interested in replicating our experiments or conducting further analyses.
2. Code

In this section, you will find the source code used to implement the genetic algorithms and associated methodologies discussed in the manuscript. The code is written in Python and is organized into separate directories based on the specific tasks and algorithms. We encourage you to explore and adapt the code to suit your own research needs.
3. Results

The results folder contains the outputs obtained from running the experiments described in the manuscript. We have included the performance metrics, visualizations, and other relevant artifacts that showcase the effectiveness of the genetic algorithms in the context of TB research. These results can be used as a reference for evaluating and comparing alternative approaches.
